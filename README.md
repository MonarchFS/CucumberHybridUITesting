# QA Automation Framework Showcase ðŸš€

This repository is a **portfolio showcase** of a Cucumber Hybrid Framework I built for UI testing.  
It demonstrates my ability to design **scalable, maintainable test automation** using Java, Selenium, and Cucumber.

- Selenium WebDriver  
- Cucumber (BDD)  
- TestNG  
- Maven  
- Jenkins (CI/CD)  
- Extent Reports

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- **Hybrid Design** â†’ Combines Data-Driven + BDD approaches  
- **Page Object Model (POM)** â†’ Reusable and maintainable test structure  
- **Reporting** â†’ Integrated with Extent Reports for execution visibility  
- **CI/CD Ready** â†’ Configured with Jenkins for automated test runs
