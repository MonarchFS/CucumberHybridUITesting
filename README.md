# QA Automation Framework Showcase ðŸš€

This repository is a **portfolio showcase** of a Cucumber Hybrid Framework I built for UI testing.  
It demonstrates my ability to design **scalable, maintainable test automation** using Java, Selenium, and Cucumber.



## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- **pages/** â†’ Page Object classes that represent UI pages and elements.  
- **utility/** â†’ Helper classes for common functionality (e.g., config reader, element utils).  
- **factory/** â†’ DriverFactory handles WebDriver initialization and setup.  
- **hooks/** â†’ Contains `MyHooks.java` for Cucumber `@Before` and `@After` hooks.  
- **runner/** â†’ Entry point for running Cucumber tests (`TestRunner.java`).  
- **stepDefinitions/** â†’ Glue code that connects feature steps to Java methods.  
- **features/** â†’ Cucumber feature files written in Gherkin syntax.  
- **config/** â†’ Configuration file (`config.properties`) for test environment settings.  
- **pom.xml** â†’ Maven dependencies (Selenium, Cucumber, JUnit Cucumber Reports, etc.).
